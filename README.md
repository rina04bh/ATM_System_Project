# ATM_System_Project
The ATM project is a Java-based application that provides essential banking functionalities such as withdrawal, deposit, PIN change, and mini statement generation. Built using Hibernate for object-relational mapping and MySQL for the backend database, the project ensures secure and efficient handling of banking transactions. Users can perform withdrawals and deposits, with the system ensuring sufficient balance and updating account information accordingly. The option to change PINs adds an extra layer of security, enhancing user control over their accounts. Additionally, users can request mini statements to view recent transactions, providing transparency and account oversight. With its robust architecture and user-friendly interface, the ATM project offers a reliable solution for basic banking operations.
